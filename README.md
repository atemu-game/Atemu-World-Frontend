# Card YOLO

This repository contains the code for the Card YOLO project .

## Description

Card YOLO is a computer vision project that aims to detect and recognize playing cards in images and videos. It utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the pre-trained YOLO weights from [here](https://example.com) and place them in the `weights/` directory.
4. Run the `main.py` script to start the card detection process.

## Usage

To use the Card YOLO project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare an image or video file containing playing cards.
2. Pass the file path as an argument to the `detect_cards()` function in the `main.py` script.
3. The script will process the file and display the detected cards along with their labels.
